# East Coast Eats
Four developers united their passion for food and travel to create East Coast Eats, a platform that showcases regional cuisines across the US. The team leveraged their programming expertise to launch an app where users can create, review, and manage restaurant listings. By offering the ability to update and delete their own listings, users can contribute to building a comprehensive directory of eateries. The developers take pride in making their favorite dining spots more accessible to fellow foodies.
